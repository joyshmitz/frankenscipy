# Performance Negative-Evidence Ledger

This ledger records every code-first performance attempt, including attempts that
are still awaiting the batch benchmark wave. Entries must name the retry
condition so dead ends are not repeated casually.

## 2026-06-18 - frankenscipy-fo9cj - sparse Arnoldi row-major basis arena

- Agent: cod-b / MistyBirch
- Lever: replace the `krylov_arnoldi_eigs` `Vec<Vec<f64>>` basis and allocating
  operator return with a row-major basis arena plus a reusable operator scratch
  buffer; switch `eigsh`, `eigs`, and `svds` callers to `csr_matvec_into` /
  `csc_matvec_into`.
- Status: pending batch-test. This is a code-first commit per campaign
  instruction; only local `cargo check -p fsci-sparse` is expected before commit.
- Correctness guard: `csc_matvec_into_matches_allocating_reference` plus existing
  `eigsh`, `eigs`, and `svds` conformance/unit coverage in the sparse crate.
- Benchmark guard: run `cargo run --profile release-perf -p fsci-sparse --bin
  perf_eigsh` and `cargo run --profile release-perf -p fsci-sparse --bin
  perf_svds` against the pre-change commit on the same worker/target dir.
- Retry condition: keep only if same-worker focused sparse eigensolver timings
  show a stable win outside noise without eigs/eigsh/svds residual drift; if the
  arena copy cost erases the allocation savings or regresses any row, reject this
  exact arena/scratch formulation and do not retry without allocator/profile
  evidence showing per-step basis allocation is again a top-5 sparse hotspot.
